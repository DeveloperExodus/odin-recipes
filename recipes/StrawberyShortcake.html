    <h3>Sweet and awesome Strawberry Shortcake!</h3>
    <br>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>1 quart strawberries, sliced</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/3 cup vegetable shortening</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups milk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 cup whipped cream</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix strawberries and 1 cup sugar in a bowl and allow to stand while you complete remaining steps. Stir occasionally to help juice form.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch round baking pan.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Combine flour, 2 tablespoons sugar, baking powder, and salt in a bowl; cut in shortening with a knife or pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir milk into crumb mixture until just blended; pour into prepared baking pan.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 15 to 20 minutes; cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing shortcake.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Split shortcake into two layers; spread bottom layer with 2 tablespoons softened butter and top with strawberries and juice. Place top layer over strawberries. Serve with whipped cream.</li>
    </ol>
